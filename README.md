Basic Task Manager (C# .NET 8 API + React TypeScript Frontend)

This project was built as part of an assignment to demonstrate full-stack development skills using C# (.NET 8) for the backend API and React/TypeScript for the frontend application.

üöÄ Project Structure

The solution is split into two main directories:

TaskManager.Api: Contains the C# .NET 8 Web API, implementing a RESTful interface and using in-memory data storage.

TaskManager.Web: Contains the React + TypeScript single-page application (SPA).

‚úÖ Functional Requirements Implemented

Display a list of tasks.

Add a new task with a description.

Toggle a task's completion status.

Delete a task.

‚ú® Enhancements Included

Task Filtering: Users can filter tasks by All, Active, and Completed statuses.

Local Storage Persistence: Tasks are synchronized with the browser's localStorage to ensure persistence across page refreshes, even though the backend is in-memory.

Basic Design: Custom CSS is used for a clean, user-friendly interface.
